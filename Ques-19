Q-19) There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
Input Format
First line contains an integer N.
Next line contains N space separated integers.
Constraints
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= Ai <= 103
Output Format
Output the minimum number of candies you can give out.
Sample Input 0
2
1 2
Sample Output 0
3
Explanation 0
The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2+1 = 3 candies need to be given out.


CODE:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int findSolution(vector<int> &ratings)
{
    int size = ratings.size();
    if(size==0)
        return 0;
 
    vector<int> leftToRight(size);
    vector<int> rightToLeft(size);
    int sum;
 
    leftToRight[0] = 1;
    for(int i=1;i<size;i++)
    {
        if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1])
            leftToRight[i] = leftToRight[i-1]+1;
        else
            leftToRight[i] = 1;
    }
    sum=leftToRight[size-1];
    rightToLeft[size-1] = 1;
 
    for(int i=size-2;i>=0;i--)
    {
        if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1])
            rightToLeft[i] = rightToLeft[i+1]+1;
 
        else
            rightToLeft[i] = 1;
        sum+=(leftToRight[i]>rightToLeft[i]?leftToRight[i]:rightToLeft[i]);
    } 
    return sum;
}
int main()

    int n,i;
    //cout<<"Enter the number of children ";
    cin>>n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    //cout<<"Enter the rating of each child"<<endl;

    {
        cin>>a[i];
    }
    //cout<<"The Minimum number of candies Alice must buy is "<<endl;
    cout<<findSolution(a)<<endl;
    return 0;
