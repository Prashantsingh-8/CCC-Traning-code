Q-22) Fibonacci Series is the sequence where every term is the sum of 2 previous terms.
Formally, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
Your task is for a given number N print the Nth Fibonacci number. You must use recursion to find the fibonacci number.
Input Format
One number N.
Constraints
0 <= N <= 12
Output Format
One number Fn.
Sample Input 0
0
Sample Output 0
0

CODE:

#include<stdio.h>
int fib(int n)
{
   if (n <= 1)
      return n;
   return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
 
int main ()
{
  int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
  printf("%d", fib(n));
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
