Q-1)  Little Kunya just started going to school. Today at school she was taught how to add two numbers. When she came back she opened the Math for kids magazine to solve the problem of the day only to find out that it asked three numbers to be added instead of two. Little Kunya only knows how to add two numbers. Can you help her solve the problem by adding three numbers? Input Format One line of input with three integers A, B and C. Constraints 1 <= A, B, C <= 10^9 Output Format One number denoting the sum of three given integers. Sample Input 0 
10 20 30
 Sample Output 0 
60 
Explanation 0
 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 so we print 60.



CODE:
#include <cmath>
 #include <cstdio> 
#include <vector>
 #include <iostream> 
#include <algorithm> 
using namespace std;
 int main() {
 /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */ 
long int a,b,c,sum=0;
 cin>>a>>b>>c;
 sum=a+b+c;
 cout<<sum;
 return 0;
 }
