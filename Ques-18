Q-18) Write a program to input 2 variables and determine which one is greater or if they are equal.
Input Format
Two numbers A and B.
Constraints
|A|, |B| <= 1000
Output Format
output "valueX is greater" where X is 1 if A is greater and X is 2 if B is greater. If A is equal to B then output "both values are equal".
Sample Input 0
15 7
Sample Output 0
value1 is greater
Sample Input 1
50 60
Sample Output 1
value2 is greater
Sample Input 2
96 96
Sample Output 2
both values are equal

CODE:
#Include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    int a,b;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    if(a>b)
        printf("value1 is greater");
    else
        if(a<b)
            printf("value2 is greater");
    else
     printf("both values are equal");
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
}
