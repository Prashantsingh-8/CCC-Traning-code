Q-7)  Given an array, Mister Arr the owner of the array wants to move each element k places to its left. I.E. the array a[0],a[1],a[2],...a[n] becomes a[1],a[2]...a[n],a[0] after moving one place to the left. Note that the first element becomes the last element after each rotation. Mister Arr was up all night watching a football match and hence is sleeping now. He has given you the task to rotate the entire array K places to its left.
Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and k (the number of left rotations you must perform). The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.
Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= k <= n
1 <= a[i] <= 10^6
Output Format
Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d left rotations.
Sample Input 0
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 0
5 1 2 3 4


CODE:

int main(void)
{
    int a[MAX], i, n, d;
    cin >> n >> d;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        cin >> a[i];
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        cout << a[(i+d)%n] << " ";
    return 0;
