What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Parliament Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square. Input Format The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a. Constraints 1 ≤  n, m, a ≤ 10^9 Output Format Write the needed number of flagstones.
