Q-6) Given an array of size N and an integer X, Raju wants to know how many elements in the array are divisible by X. Help him find the answer. Input Format First line contains 2 integers N and X. Second line contains N integers, the array arr[N]. 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= arr[i], X <= 100 Output Format One number denoting the count of elements that are divisible by X.
 Sample Input 0
 5 2
 2 4 3 2 1
 Sample Output 0
 3

CODE:

#include <stdio.h>
 int main() {
 int a,b,i,c=0,arr[100];
 scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
 for(i=0;i<a;i++) {
 scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
 if(arr[i]%b==0) c+=1;
 }
 printf("%d",c);
 return 0;
 }
